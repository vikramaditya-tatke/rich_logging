# rich_logging

This repository demonstrates how to use the Rich library in Python to produce structured, visually appealing logs in the console, even while displaying progress bars in multi-threaded applications. The approach is general and can be adapted to interact with various APIs or databases, providing clear, real-time feedback and structured logging for any integration or automation task.

## General Usage

If you want to use this repository for other APIs or databases, you would:
- Integrate with the target API or database
- Perform operations (such as querying, updating, or processing data)
- Use Rich to log progress, status, and results in a structured and readable format, even when running multiple threads or tasks concurrently

## sentinelone_example.py

The `sentinelone_example.py` file specifically demonstrates how to interact with the SentinelOne API using Python, while leveraging the Rich library for logging and progress visualization. It does the following:

- **API Integration:** Connects to the SentinelOne API using provided credentials or configuration.
- **Data Retrieval:** Fetches information from SentinelOne, such as endpoints, threats, or other security-related data.
- **Multi-threading:** Processes multiple API requests or data items in parallel using threads, improving efficiency for large datasets or slow network operations.
- **Progress Bars:** Displays real-time progress bars in the console for ongoing operations, giving clear feedback on the status of each task.
- **Structured Logging:** Uses Rich to output logs in a structured, color-coded, and readable format, making it easy to track successes, failures, and important events as they happen.
- **Error Handling:** Logs errors and exceptions in a clear manner, helping with debugging and monitoring.

In summary, `sentinelone_example.py` is a practical example of how to combine API automation, multi-threading, and advanced console logging for a real-world security integration scenario.
